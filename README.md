# MATH376

## *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*

This is my final project for the course MATH376. The topic I chose was mathematical climate modeling, with a focus on the use of delay differential equations.

This repo contains the LaTeX source files and Mathematica code used. Note that the Mathematica code is in the form of Notebook files, so should not be opened as a standard text file (they are quite large).
